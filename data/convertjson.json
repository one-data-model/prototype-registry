If X or Y are set to a value greater than the size of the display, the position \\\"wraps around\\\" to the modulus of the setting and the display size. Likewise, if the text string overflows the display size, the text \\\"wraps around\\\" and displays on the next line down or, if the last line has been written, wraps around to the top of the display. Brightness and Contrast controls are provided to allow control of various display types including STN and DSTN type LCD character displays. Writing an empty payload to the Clear Display resource causes the display to be erased."

Qualitative is a representative value within the range provided where the minimum value is minimum contamination and maximum value is maximum contamination for the specific contaminant. The Property \\\"contaminantvalue\\\" contains the actual measured or qualitative level. The Property \\\"range\\\" contains the allowed range for the value that is being reported. If valueType is 'Measured' then the units for the contaminant types are as follows: Methanol (also known as Formaldehyde): CH2O (ug/m^3), Carbon Dioxide: CO2 (ppm), Carbon Monoxide: CO (ppm), Particulate Matter (less than 1 micron in diameter): PM1 (ug/m^3), Particulate Matter (less than 2. 5 microns in diameter): PM2. 5 (ug/m^3), Particulate Matter (less than 10 microns in diameter): PM10 (ug/m^3), Volatile Organic Compounds: VOC (ug/m^3)."
